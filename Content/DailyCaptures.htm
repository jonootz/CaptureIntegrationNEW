        <p class="Hwork" style="text-align: center;">“Part-Time Work Ethic: Should Teens go for it?,” Chapter 1 Summary</p>
        <p class="Hwork" style="text-align: center;">In Dennis McLellan’s article, “Part-Time Work Ethic: Should Teens go for it?,” he discusses the pros and cons of teenagers having part-time jobs while going to school.  First, there are many positive aspects to teens working.  McLellan states that having a job “Builds character, teaches responsibility, and prepares them for the adult world,” by showing teens how to complete projects thoroughly and on time (280).  Clearly, jobs can be beneficial to teenagers.  Along with all of these positive aspects; however, there are also negative effects.  In fact, teenage workers have been “stealing money,” “merchandise,” and even “showing up to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol” (281-82).  The author makes a point that not everything about part-time jobs is beneficial to students.  As a teenager I worked part-time at a clothing retailer.  I definitely learned personal responsibility in relation to both my work schedule and financial responsibility.  I would most certainly fall on the side of the positive aspect of teens working.</p>
